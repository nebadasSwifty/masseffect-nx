     * Merging predicated blocks.
     *
     * The translator emitted an `if (p0) { ... }` for every predicated instruction, nested
     * inside the `if (p0)` of the EXEC block as well. In p_000101 (the ground with shadow)
     * that was 75 OpBranchConditional, 206 OpLabel and 49 OpPhi for 10 texture samples and
     * 49 scalar operations. The worst part is not the cost of the branch: the 9 PCF taps end
     * up in 9 different basic blocks, so the scheduler cannot issue them together and the
     * texture latency is paid nine times instead of once. The scene runs at 31 % of peak
     * arithmetic throughput.
     *
     * With this, consecutive predicated instructions with the same predicate share a single
     * block. The semantics are identical (not a single operation is touched), except for the
     * rule that forces a close:
     *
     *   1. before an unpredicated instruction,
     *   2. after any instruction that writes p0 (otherwise the next one would run testing
     *      the old p0: that would change the result),
     *   3. at every control flow boundary (EXEC, jump, loop, return).
     *
     * predOpen_: -1 none, 0 open with !p0, 1 open with p0.
     */
    int predOpen_ = -1;

    /*
     * The close is lazy, so merging also works across EXEC blocks.
     *
     * The first version of the merge only joined instructions inside the same EXEC block,
     * because every control flow boundary forces a close (rule 3). But the Xenos splits
     * blocks every few instructions on its own (the EXEC cannot hold more), and the result
     * was that the nine PCF samples still fell into three basic blocks:
     *
     *     if (p0) { ...tap 1... }
     *     if (p0) { ...taps 2-7... }     <- three EXECs in a row, same p0, nothing in between
     *     if (p0) { ...taps 8-9... }
     *
     * Between the `}` and the next `if` nothing is emitted: no conditional EXEC, no jump,
     * no loop, no p0 write. So the `}` is redundant and so is the `if` after it.
     *
     * So the close is not decided on the spot: it is written, and if the next thing to be
     * emitted opens again with the same condition and nothing has been written in between,
     * the `}` is deleted and emission continues inside the same block. The check is on the
     * text (`closingEnd_ == out.size()`), which is exactly the condition needed: anything that
     * could change p0 (or put control flow in between) emits text, and then there is no
     * merge. The only exception is the close caused by a p0 write (the text was emitted
     * before the `}`), and that one is marked by hand as not cancelable.
     *
     * 185 of the 298 predicated blocks of the 109 pixel shaders merge this way (113 remain),
     * and 20 of the 36 in the vertex shaders. The nine shadow map taps end up in a single
     * basic block, which is what the scheduler needed to issue them together.
     *
     * Almost none of those blocks are opened by openPredicate(): they are opened by the
     * control flow's own CondExecPred, which in this game comes in runs of three or four in
     * a row with the same predicate. That is why the close that must be undoable is also
     * the CondExecPred one, and why recompile() records its brace with noteClosingCf().
     * There is one more condition there that is not needed here: if some instruction in the
     * block wrote p0, the next block has to test the new p0 and merging would leave it with
     * the old one. That shows in predGuaranteed_, which closeIfWritesPredicate() sets to
     * -1 right when it happens.
