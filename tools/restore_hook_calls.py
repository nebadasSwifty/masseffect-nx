# Targeted counterpart of tools/direct_calls.py for NEW hooks on an already post-processed generated tree.
#
# direct_calls.py rewrites `sub_X(ctx, base);` into `__imp__sub_X(ctx, base);` for every function that has no hook
# (the address appearing in the sources decides). A hook added afterwards is bypassed by those direct calls. This
# reverts only the given addresses, so only the files that really call them are touched (and rebuilt); a later full
# run of direct_calls.py (tools/codegen.sh) keeps them as hooks because the addresses are in the sources.
#
#   usage: restore_hook_calls.py [--gen <generated dir>] 82AA53C0 82B4D580 ...
