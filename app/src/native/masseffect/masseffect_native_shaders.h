// The ring only carries the microcode. The library stores the original
// compiled container (header, constant table, definitions and microcode)
// with its SPIR-V translation made by XenosRecomp.
//
// Pixel shaders arrive as is and are identified by their microcode. Vertex
// shaders do not: D3D reorders the fetches, changes their swizzles and
// nulls the outputs the pixel shader does not read (measured), so their
// identity comes from the device objects (the D3D object table) and only
// the vertex input is read from the patched microcode.
