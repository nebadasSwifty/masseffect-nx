// masseffect - native renderer: deduplication of vertex uploads within a frame.
//
// The problem, measured
// ---------------------
// Every draw copies to the upload buffer the [vmin..vmax] range of each of its vertex bindings,
// with the byte order swapped. There is no cache: the same piece of geometry is copied again in
// full every time it is drawn.
//
//   Console, last 10 s stretch of gameplay (masseffect_001.log):
//       vertices 2044.9 MB in 269 frames = 7.60 MB per frame = 204 MB/s
//       CPU write speed into the upload buffer's memory type (type 1, no CPU cache,
//       coherent) = 2462 MB/s  ->  3.09 ms per frame just writing
//
//   PC, with the masseffect_native_diag_vertices_repeated diagnostic on, steady gameplay:
//       "5954.9 MB copied; 2584.2 MB repeated within the same frame and
//        3329.2 MB identical to an earlier frame"
//       -> 99.0-99.6 % of the bytes are byte-for-byte repeats, in eight reports in a row.
//          Of those, 41-49 % repeat within the same frame.
//
// What this piece does
// --------------------
// Only the safe half: the same-frame one. A table from (physical address, bytes, order) to the
// offset that copy already occupies in this frame's upload buffer. If a later draw asks for
// exactly the same range with the same order, the existing offset is bound and nothing is copied.
//
// Why it is exact and not a gamble
// --------------------------------
// On the Xbox 360 the GPU reads vertices from main memory when it executes the draw, not when
// the game records the packet. A title cannot rewrite a vertex range it has already referenced
// in this frame without first synchronizing with the GPU: if it did, the result on the original
// console would not be defined either. So between two draws of the same frame with no
// synchronization in between, the contents of that range are the same by construction.
//
// The points where the guest may have rewritten memory are the synchronizations. Forget() is
// called there and the table is cleared. With that, deduplication does not rely on any
// assumption.
//
// What it does not do (on purpose)
// --------------------------------
// The other half (the 51-59 % that is equal to an earlier frame) needs a persistent buffer and
// a content check (XXH3 of the guest bytes, as the texture cache does with raw_fingerprint). It is
// more expensive and more delicate than this half, which is free.
//
// How it is wired in (masseffect_native_draws.cpp)
// ---------------------------------------------
//   - UseSlot(...)      : dedupe_.NewFrame(frame_);   // after ++frame_
//       This already covers SendAndWait: despite its name it does not wait for anything, it
//       switches work slots, and that goes through UseSlot, which resets used_upload_ and
//       bumps frame_. Old offsets die on their own.
//   - dedupe_.Forget() where the ring thread serves a guest wait for the GPU (a fence or a
//     WAIT_REG_MEM): the only point where the game can legally rewrite a range it already drew.
//
//   Beware of masseffect_native_send_after_shadows: when true, the shadow pass ends in one slot and
//   the scene in the next, so the scene cannot reuse the shadow copies and half the savings
//   are lost.
//   - in the bindings loop of the draw path, before Reserve/EnqueueCopy:
//         VkDeviceSize offset;
//         if (dedupe_.Search(source.address, source.bytes, uint32_t(source.order), offset)) {
//           vertex_offsets[b] = offset;
//           continue;                       // already in this frame's upload buffer
//         }
//         Reserve(source.bytes, 4, offset);
//         ... (the usual copy) ...
//         dedupe_.Note(source.address, source.bytes, uint32_t(source.order), offset);
//
// The table has kSlots entries of 40 bytes (640 KB) and is cleared by generation, without
// memset.
