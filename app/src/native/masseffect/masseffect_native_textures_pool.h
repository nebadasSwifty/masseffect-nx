// masseffect - native renderer: sub-allocation pool for textures.
//
// Why it exists (measured, not estimated)
//
//   Without the pool, every texture gets its own dedicated allocation: CreateTexture ->
//   rex::ui::vulkan::util::CreateDedicatedAllocationImage -> vkAllocateMemory with
//   VkMemoryDedicatedAllocateInfo. On Horizon that is not a cheap call.
//
//   What every texture pays, following the chain in the Mesa tree:
//     1. nvk_AllocateMemory (nvk_device_memory.c:133); in the __SWITCH__ branch
//        (:178-193) it sets alignment, tile_mode and pte_kind.
//     2. nvkmd_switch_dev_alloc_mem_impl (nvkmd/switch/nvkmd_switch_dev.c:750-838):
//        memory_create -> memory_map -> alloc_va (VA #1) -> va_bind_mem (mapping #1).
//     3. nouveau_horizon_memory_create (horizon/nouveau_horizon_memory.c:468-663):
//        memalign + nvMapCreate (:572) and, always, memset(size) + armDCacheClean(size)
//        (:612-620), even though Vulkan does not ask for ZERO_INITIALIZE.
//     4. nvk_image_plane_bind (nvk_image.c:1697-1707): since our textures are
//        SAMPLED|TRANSFER_DST, nvk_image_can_compress returns false (nvk_image.c:843-846),
//        so the dedicated shortcut is not taken: a VA #2 is reserved with the block-linear
//        pte_kind and a mapping #2 is made.
//
//   In short: the dedicated allocation costs twice the VAs and mappings and gives nothing back.
//   Its only benefit is compression, and our textures are never compressible.
//
// The measurement (console, entering a new zone)
//
//   From the profile log (translated): "new NvMaps 17.6 with cache
//   (2.8 MB) and 0.3 without cache (0.0 MB), 7.8 ms | GPU addresses 35.4 (4.0 ms), mappings
//   35.4 (0.0 MB, 19.2 ms)"
//   -> 31.0 ms/s of CPU just allocating and mapping. And 35.4/17.9 = 1.98: two VAs and two
//      mappings per NvMap, exactly what the code above predicts.
//
//   Medians per call, 80 intervals with >=5 allocations/s across several logs
//   (the counters come from the --wrap wrappers in the Switch perf shim):
//     nvMapCreate                422 us
//     nvAddressSpaceAllocFixed   127 us
//     MapBufferEx                626 us
//     One texture (1 + 2 + 2)   ~1.9 ms
//
//   Real peaks: 159 ms/s (16 % of a core) and 298.7 ms/s (30 % of a core).
//
//   The driver's BO cache does not save this: in a long measurement it hits 88 % and
//   everything is still paid, because recycling saves the nvMapCreate but not the VA or the
//   mapping, which are the expensive two thirds.
//
// What this pool saves
//
//   Per texture only the plane's VA and its partial mapping remain: 1.9 ms -> ~0.75 ms (-60 %).
//     Bad stretch:                  31.0 ms/s -> 18.8 ms/s   (-12.2 ms/s)
//     Average frame (~27 FPS):       1.15 ms  ->  0.70 ms    (-0.45 ms)
//     Burst of 15 textures:         28.5 ms   -> 11.3 ms     (-17.2 ms)
//   It is a variance fix, not an average one: allocation explains 9 % of the average gap
//   but 17 of the 44 ms of the worst frame, which is what is noticeable when turning.
//
//   As a bonus: live NvMap handles drop from ~3,600 to ~12, and with them the ceiling of
//   the area shared with nvdrv goes away (error 0x235C, which showed up as a black screen).
//
// Why not a single pixel changes
//
//   Binding at offset != 0 into non-dedicated memory is supported and keeps the block-linear
//   layout: NVK reserves a VA of its own for the plane with the right pte_kind and maps the
//   sub-range (nvk_image.c -> nouveau_horizon_vm.c).
//   The size vkGetImageMemoryRequirements returns is already rounded to 64 KiB precisely for
//   this (nvk_image.c:1422-1428), and requiresDedicatedAllocation is never true on Switch
//   (nvk_image.c:1444-1460). The slabs are allocated without VkMemoryDedicatedAllocateInfo,
//   so their layout.valid is false and they accept any pte_kind (nvkmd_switch_dev.c:787-795,
//   nouveau_horizon_memory.c:1056-1073).
//   No compression is lost because there was none (nvk_image.c:843-846).
//
// Safety invariant (mandatory, read before touching eviction)
//
//   Without the pool, if the GPU read a texture that was just destroyed it would read memory
//   that was freed but still mapped: harmless garbage. With the pool it would read the pixels
//   of another texture, because the physical block is reused immediately.
//
//   That is only safe while both of these conditions hold. The current code meets them, and
//   they are mandatory:
//     a) Normal eviction only releases textures unused for 120 frames
//        (kFramesNoUsageForDrop in masseffect_native_draws.cpp). No pending work
//        can reference them.
//     b) Emergency eviction (DropTexturesPerMissingOfMemory) calls
//        WaitGpuOfTheAll() first.
//   If that threshold of 120 is ever lowered or that wait removed, this pool is no longer
//   safe and releasing a block must be delayed by a few frames.
//
// Single thread
//
//   All of this lives on the ring thread (PrepareTexture and the render targets),
//   so there is no lock. If a texture is ever created from another thread, a lock must be
//   added here first.
