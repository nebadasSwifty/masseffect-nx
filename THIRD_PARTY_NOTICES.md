# Third-party notices

This port is built on the work of other projects. Their licenses apply to their code and to the parts of this
repository derived from it. New code written for this port is copyright (c) 2026 NebadasSwifty and is under the license
of the folder it is in (see below).

## Projects this port is derived from

| Project | Used for | License |
|---|---|---|
| [NFSMW Recompiled](https://github.com/madelrandel-blip/NFSMW-Recompiled) by madelrandel-blip | The recompilation project this port started from: the structure of `app/` (application hooks, configuration, code generator setup) and the build and analysis scripts in `tools/` | GPL-3.0 |
| [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) v0.10.0 by Tom Clay, with portions from [Xenia](https://xenia.jp) (Ben Vanik and the Xenia contributors) | `sdk/`: code generator, Xbox 360 kernel and runtime, GPU command processing, XMA audio, virtual file system | BSD-3-Clause (`sdk/LICENSE`) |
| Horizon (Switch) layer of the SDK by StevenSND | `sdk/src/**/*_switch.*`, `sdk/src/ui/switch_*.cpp`, `sdk/src/input/switch/`, `sdk/src/audio/switch/`, `sdk/cmake/rexglue_switch.cmake`, `sdk/switch_compat/`: guest memory, exception handling, threading, input, audio, presentation, clocks | BSD-3-Clause (as part of the SDK) |
| Scripts and toolchain file by StevenSND | `tools/find_gaps.py`, `tools/read_before_write.py`, `tools/direct_calls.py`, `tools/fetch_thirdparty.py`, `tools/switch/cmake/switch-devkitA64.cmake`, adapted for this game | GPL-3.0 |
| [XenosRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenosRecomp) by hedge-dev and contributors, with shader tooling and changes by StevenSND | `shaders/XenosRecomp`: Xenos microcode to HLSL translator; `shaders/tools`: the shader library tools | MIT (`shaders/LICENSE.md`) |
| [mesa-switch](https://github.com/danfromtico/mesa-switch) by danfromtico (with NaGaa95's updates), on top of [Mesa](https://mesa3d.org); the base of the Mesa patch is the work of StevenSND | The Vulkan driver (NVK) and shader compiler (NAK) for Horizon, linked into the NRO; `mesa/` holds the changes and the build scripts | MIT (Mesa's licenses per file) |

The Horizon (Switch) layer added to `sdk/` is under the SDK's BSD-3-Clause license, and the changes in `shaders/` and
`mesa/` under the licenses of those projects (MIT), so they can be reused by other ports. The rest of this repository
(`app/`, `tools/`, `tests/`, `installer/`, `docs/`) is GPL-3.0 (`LICENSE`).

## Libraries

Libraries used by the SDK, the NRO and the code generator. They are not stored in this repository except for the
files listed below: `tools/fetch_thirdparty.py` fetches them from ReXGlue SDK v0.10.0 (commit `c94f5ebdcb3c`) and its
submodules into `sdk/thirdparty`.

| Library | License |
|---|---|
| [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (libavcodec, libavutil: the XMA audio decoder and, from a fork addition, a WMV3 decoder that Mass Effect does not use), from the FFmpeg submodule of ReXGlue SDK v0.10.0 | LGPL-2.1-or-later (configured without GPL parts) |
| [libmspack](https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/) by Stuart Caie (LZX decompression) | LGPL-2.1 |

| [aes_128](https://github.com/openluopworld/aes_128) by LuoPeng, [tiny-AES-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c) | see the license file of each in the fetched tree (`sdk/thirdparty/aes_128`, `sdk/thirdparty/tiny-aes-c`) |
| disruptorplus, the RenderDoc API header and the PowerPC disassembler (`disasm`) as shipped with ReXGlue SDK v0.10.0 | see the license file of each in the fetched tree |
| [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) and the devkitA64 runtime (newlib, libstdc++) | ISC; newlib and GCC runtime licenses |

Only for builds on a computer or for the tests, never in the Switch NRO: SDL3 (zlib), MoltenVK and the Vulkan loader
(Apache-2.0), Catch2 (BSL-1.0).

### FFmpeg and libmspack (LGPL)

This port modifies these files of the SDK's third-party tree; the modified copies are in `sdk/thirdparty`:

- `FFmpeg/libavcodec/fft_template.c` and `FFmpeg/libavcodec/mdct_template.c`
- `FFmpeg/config.h`, plus `FFmpeg/config_switch_aarch64.h` and `FFmpeg/config_masseffect_wmv3.h` (new): the
  configuration for AArch64 Horizon and for a build that also contains the WMV3 decoder
- `ffmpeg-overlay/codec_list.c`: the list of registered codecs (the XMA frames decoder, the WMA decoders, MP3 and WMV3)
- `CMakeLists.txt`: builds the libraries for the Switch

The rest of FFmpeg and libmspack is the unmodified upstream source at the commits pinned by ReXGlue SDK v0.10.0.
Everything needed to rebuild and relink the NRO with a modified version of either library is in this repository and in
[docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

## Installer page

The installer page (`installer/`, part of this repository) runs WebAssembly builds of the shader translator and packer
from `shaders/` (the scanner includes its own LZO1X decoder) and, when it is built, [DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler)
(University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, with LLVM's license terms). The WebAssembly build uses
[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) (MIT and the University of Illinois/NCSA license).
