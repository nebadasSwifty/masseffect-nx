/*
 * Publish FPS and resolution where the console monitor reads them, and obey Reverse-NX.
 *
 * The FPS counter of those overlays (Status Monitor Overlay and its forks, such as "Horizon OC
 * Monitor") is not computed by them: it is read from shared memory published by SaltyNX. That
 * memory is filled in by NX-FPS, which hooks the game's present call (nvnQueuePresentTexture,
 * eglSwapBuffers or vkQueuePresentKHR). Our game goes through none of the three (NVK is linked
 * inside the NRO and talks to nvdrv), so there is nothing to hook and the field stays empty.
 *
 * Here we write the block ourselves. The format is SaltyNX's (struct NxFpsSharedBlock, 174 packed
 * bytes, magic 0x465053), and the overlay finds it by scanning the shared memory 4 bytes at a time.
 *
 * The Reverse-NX block (magic "NXRT") is read as well; that one does publish its state even though
 * it cannot hook us: this way the game can follow the handheld/docked mode chosen in its overlay
 * without putting the console in the dock.
 *
 * If SaltyNX is not installed, the port does not exist and nothing is done here.
 *
 * References: masagrator/SaltyNX (saltysd_core), masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay
 * (source/Utils.hpp) and masagrator/ReverseNX-RT (Overlay/include/SaltyNX.h).
