/**
 * @file        rex/os/switch/runtime_switch.cpp
 * @brief       libnx startup constants for the Switch executable
 *
 * This file is compiled directly into the final executable, not into a
 * library.
 *
 * Everything here replaces weak libnx symbols, and crt0 only references them
 * weakly. A weak reference does not pull an object out of a static library, so
 * if this ended up in rexcore.a the linker would silently ignore it and the
 * defaults would be used: no error, no warning, and the process starting in a
 * different state than expected. skate3recomp-nx solves it the same way, adding
 * it to the game target.
 *
 * The values are those of MarathonRecomp-NX, a finished Horizon port.

 * the kernel to reserve memory of its own for the page tables. If the heap takes
 * everything, that memory does not exist.
 *
 * Measured on the console: with an uncapped heap, the game died with "could not
 * commit 0x1000 bytes" (kernel 2001-0103, out of memory) at ~1.8 GB mapped,
 * and even a 4 KB request and thread creation failed.
 *
 * It was lowered from 1,536 to 1,024 MB in case the NVIDIA driver was short of
 * room. That was not it: the 3,185 of 3,189 MB in the profiler is
 * InfoType_UsedMemorySize, which does not move on Horizon (it is the same with
 * 1,536 as with 1,024, and already before anything is loaded), so it does not
 * measure what it seemed to. It stays at 1,024 because that is enough, not
 * because it fixed anything.
 *
 * 1,024 MB leave plenty of room for what lives in the heap (the guest backing,
 * measured at 506 MB, the host thread stacks at 16 MB each, and whatever Mesa
 * asks for) and leave the rest free for the mappings. What the GPU uses
 * (textures, buffers and compiled shaders) does not come from here.
