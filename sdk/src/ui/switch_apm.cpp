/*
 * Horizon console performance profile (apm).
 *
 * Why
 *   The GPU runs at 307.2 MHz in handheld mode and it is one of the two walls of the port (the other
 *   is the CPU, with three cores at 85-99 %). Nintendo later released the 460.8 MHz handheld profile
 *   precisely for games that need it, and this one does: 25 FPS with the GPU at its limit. It is not
 *   an overclock: no KIP or sysmodule is touched, it is requested through Horizon's official API
 *   (apm), the same one any commercial game uses. That is why not every game requests it: those that
 *   do not need it get longer battery life.
 *
 *   307.2 -> 460.8 MHz is +50 % of GPU.
 *
 * Memory is not touched
 *   The first version raised the memory from 1331.2 to 1597.5 MHz by accident: apm does not take MHz,
 *   it takes a configuration number, and the high-GPU configurations come in two flavors, with EMC
 *   1331.2 and with EMC 1600. The 1600 one got in. A clock overlay showed it, and a commercial game
 *   runs at GPU 460.8 with MEM 1331.2: so that combination exists and it is the one we want.
 *
 *   Raising the memory clock uses more battery and heat without giving us anything: our own
 *   measurements say bandwidth is at 27 % and what saturates is the fragment ALU.
 *
 * The three rounds it took, and what each one taught
 *
 *   1. It applied the configuration and read the clocks on the next line. The log said "the
 *      memory stays at 1331.2" and the session profile recorded 1600.0 in every sample. They
 *      did not contradict each other: it was checked too early. apm hands the change to pcv and
 *      the clocks are applied later, so the immediate read returned the old value. The same bug
 *      left dead a fix that only lowered the EMC by hand "if it is detected that it went up": it
 *      was never detected.
 *
 *   2. A 250 ms wait plus a once-per-second watchdog that lowered the EMC with clkrst. The log said
 *      the two things that needed knowing:
 *        - after 250 ms the memory was still at 1331.2 (so the raise takes between 0.25 and ~1 s,
 *          and 250 ms was not enough either);
 *        - the watchdog found it at 1600 and lowered it eight times with clkrst; all eight were
 *          accepted and all eight were reverted by the system. pcv reimposes the EMC of the active
 *          apm configuration, and clkrst cannot fight that.
 *
 *   3. So the problem was never how to lower the memory, but which configuration is requested.
 *      0x92220007 is "GPU 460.8 + EMC 1600", and its sibling 0x92220008 is "GPU 460.8 + EMC
 *      1331.2": that is the right one, and it was missing from the list (a nonexistent 0x92220006
 *      was there instead). Now:
 *        1. the table has the real IDs, sorted with the low EMC first;
 *        2. the check is a 1.5 s poll (StillMemoryDuring), not a single read;
 *        3. the watchdog stays as a safety net, in case the system reimposes the EMC on a mode
 *           change or when waking from sleep.
 *
 *   It only ever lowers back to what the console had at the start: nothing is ever raised above
 *   that. And if this firmware did not have the "high GPU + unchanged RAM" pair, the GPU is left
 *   as it was rather than raising the RAM; masseffect_switch_ram_1600 opts into that trade.
