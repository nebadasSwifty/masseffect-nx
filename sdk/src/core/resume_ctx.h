/*
 * Resuming a thread after an exception on Horizon.
 *
 * This is the part that is not obvious and takes a long time to find out:
 *
 * __libnx_exception_handler is not a POSIX signal handler. It runs as a normal
 * function, on the exception stack, and returning from it does not resume the
 * thread: the libnx entry code already handed control back to the kernel to jump
 * to the handler, so svcReturnFromException from here is an invalid SVC.
 *
 * The first version jumped back by hand, and it broke the game
 *
 * It reloaded the registers from the dump and did `br x16`, assuming x16 was
 * dead and leaving x18 untouched. Both assumptions are false at any instruction
 * that is not a call: GCC uses x16, x17 and x18 as normal registers inside a
 * function. In one game, a recompiled function read a constant from the XEX image (a
 * read-only page, unmapped), the handler emulated it, and on return x16 held the
 * resume address instead of 0x145c. The next write went to 0x80E814E4 and the
 * game closed. A manual jump always needs a register for the target, so there is
 * no fix along that path.
 *
 * How it is done now: through the kernel
 *
 * svcReturnFromException restores x0-x8, lr, sp, pc and pstate from the kernel
 * frame, and leaves the other registers as they are at that moment. So:
 *
 *   1. The dump is copied to the stack of the faulting thread, below its sp,
 *      where nothing overwrites it. The global libnx dump could be overwritten
 *      by a fault in another thread.
 *   2. NEON, x9-x28 and fp are loaded from that copy.
 *   3. An exception is raised on purpose (the udf in RexResumeTrap), with x8
 *      pointing to the copy.
 *   4. The exception entry (exception_handler_switch.cpp) recognizes the trap
 *      address, writes x0-x8, lr, sp, pc and pstate from the copy into the
 *      frame, and calls svcReturnFromException without touching anything else.
 *
 * It costs one extra exception per resume, and in exchange not a single bit is
 * lost: every register gets back the value of the corrected dump.
