/*
 * POSIX compatibility layer for threads on Horizon.
 *
 * Why a layer and not a separate version
 *
 * threading_posix.cpp is 1,546 lines and newlib has real pthreads, so most of it
 * works as is. Only four things are missing, and forking the whole file for that
 * would doom the port to diverge from the SDK on every update. This fills the
 * gaps and leaves the original almost untouched.
 *
 * What newlib lacks, and what fills it
 *
 *   cpu_set_t and CPU_*          own bit structure
 *   pthread_[gs]etaffinity_np    svcGetThreadCoreMask / svcSetThreadCoreMask
 *   pthread_[gs]etschedparam     svcGetThreadPriority / svcSetThreadPriority
 *   PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST         Horizon has no robust mutexes: no effect
 *   SA_RESTART                   does not exist; defined as 0
 *
 * What cannot be filled
 *
 * Horizon does not deliver signals. The SDK's thread suspension works through
 * signals (SIGRTMIN+n or SIGUSR1/2), and that cannot work here however much
 * shimming is added. It is replaced by svcSetThreadActivity, the real
 * mechanism. See threading_switch.cpp.
 *
 * The thread registry, and why it is needed
 *
 * libnx exposes no public way to get the Horizon Handle from another thread's
 * pthread_t; only threadGetCurHandle() for the calling thread. Since the SDK
 * changes the priority and affinity of other threads, a registry of our own is
 * kept, which each thread fills in when it starts.
