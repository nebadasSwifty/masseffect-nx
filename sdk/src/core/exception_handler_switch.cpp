/**
 * @file        rex/core/exception_handler_switch.cpp
 * @brief       ExceptionHandler for Horizon, on top of a single __libnx_exception_handler
 *
 * How a fault arrives on Horizon, which is not how it does on POSIX
 *
 * All measured on the console (see docs/platform-notes.md), not assumed:
 *
 *  - There are no signals. A fault reaches __libnx_exception_handler, which libnx calls
 *    as a normal function on a stack of its own.
 *  - Returning from it kills the process. To continue, RexResumeFromException
 *    (resume_ctx.h) raises a trap exception and the entry below returns the corrected
 *    context with svcReturnFromException.
 *  - The ESR carries the WnR bit (read or write) but arrives with ISV = 0: it gives
 *    neither the register nor the size. Emulating an access requires decoding.
 *  - libnx accepts a single handler. What on POSIX are separate signal handlers (this
 *    one and the SEH one) must all go through here.
 *
 * The decision order, and why
 *
 *  0. Uncommitted guest physical memory -> 4 MB is committed and the access retried.
 *     Physical memory is no longer committed in full at startup: on Horizon those
 *     512 MB are counted once for each of the 360's five views and the kernel ends
 *     up refusing allocations (see xmemory.cpp).
 *
 *  1. Read from a watched guest page -> emulated through the shadow and never reaches
 *     the SDK. It has to be like this: on Switch a read-only page is unmapped, and if
 *     the fault reached the MMIO handler, it would see kReadOnly, conclude that another
 *     thread already removed the watch and retry the instruction... which would fault
 *     again, forever.
 *
 *  2. The handlers installed by the SDK (MMIO, write watching), in installation order,
 *     as on POSIX.
 *
 *     If one reports "handled" and leaves the PC where it was (that is, asks for a
 *     retry), whether the page ended up mapped is checked right then. If it did not,
 *     the retry would loop forever, so it is emulated through the shadow. This covers
 *     the case where remapping from the handler does not work on Horizon, without
 *     relying on heuristics.
 *
 *  3. SEH, if in use. See seh_switch.cpp.
 *
 *  4. Fatal: registers, address and stack to <NRO folder>/logs/rex/rex_crash.log, and
 *     error 2345-0102 on screen.
 *
 * Faults on several threads at once, and why they broke the game
 *
 * libnx has one exception stack and one dump, both global. With a single thread that
 * works; here it does not. The profiler counts hundreds or thousands of faults per
 * second spread over twenty-odd threads, so two coincide every so often, and then:
 *
 *  - the second thread writes its dump over the first one's, and the first resumes
 *    with the second one's registers (silent guest corruption, impossible to track);
 *  - both run on the same stack and overwrite each other's frames.
 *
 * Measured on the console while loading a race: two threads inside the handler with
 * their sp 0xD0 apart, one waiting for the guest memory lock and the other with a
 * mutex pointer turned into 1. The latter killed the process (report in
 * rex_crash.log, 2345-0102).
 *
 * Fix: REX_EXC_SLOTS stack + dump sets. The entry takes a free one with
 * ldaxr/stlxr, points the dump and sp at it, and stores the slot number in pad[0] of
 * the dump. On resume, the trap branch reads it from the copy and releases the slot:
 * at that point the thread no longer runs on that stack, so another one can take it
 * without overwriting anything. If none is free it waits; waiting is better than
 * corrupting.

 * linked binary), with one extra branch at the start: if the frame's pc is RexResumeTrap, the
 * exception is the resume from resume_ctx.h, not a fault. Then x0-x8, lr, sp, pc and pstate are
 * copied into the frame from the dump x8 points to, and it returns with svcReturnFromException
 * without touching x9-x29 or NEON, which already hold their values.
 *
 * The rest is libnx's: bail out if a debugger is attached (unless __nx_exception_ignoredebug), copy
 * the frame and the live registers to __nx_exceptiondump, and return from the kernel to
 * RexExceptionReturnEntry on the exception stack with x0 pointing to the dump.

  // --- 1. read from a watched page: emulated through the shadow -------------
  //
  // On Switch there is no such thing as a read-only page: as soon as the GPU watches a
  // chunk of physical memory, that chunk is unmapped, and then every guest read of it
  // faults. And reading does not remove the watch, so it faults again, and again, as
  // long as the game keeps reading from there. Measured in a race: 83,000 emulated
  // reads per second, more than half a core.
  //
  // Treating the read as a write was tried, and it does not work. The cost went away
  // (83,000 faults/s dropped to 21, and CPU from 292% to 118%) but the game froze while
  // loading a race, with all its threads asleep waiting for something that never came.
  // The reason is in PhysicalHeap::TriggerCallbacks: reporting a write does not only
  // unwatch the page that faulted but up to 4 MB around it (unwatch_exact_range =
  // false), and it also tells the GPU caches that the range changed. With that, write
  // watching was left almost empty (the SDK handler's faults dropped from 240/s to
  // 11/s) and coherence between the guest and the GPU broke.
  //
  // So it is still emulated through the shadow, which is correct even if expensive.
  // This is now resolved above, in point (1) of the hot path, without asking again.
  // The reasoning stays written here because it explains why it cannot be done any
  // other way.
