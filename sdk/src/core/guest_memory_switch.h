/*
 * Guest memory on Horizon: reservation, commit, aliases and protection.
 *
 * This is the core of the port. Everything here was measured on the console, not
 * assumed; see docs/platform-notes.md.
 *
 * The problem
 *
 * ReXGlue inherits from Xenia a memory map with three requirements:
 *   1. a contiguous reservation of 0x120000000 (4.5 GB) of virtual space
 *   2. aliases: several guest virtual windows pointing to the same
 *      physical memory (0xA0000000, 0xC0000000 and 0xE0000000 are mirrors)
 *   3. page faults to emulate MMIO and to watch writes
 *
 * And Horizon imposes three restrictions that clash head-on:
 *   1. there is no sparse memory: you cannot reserve 4.5 GB and then commit
 *      page by page. There is only 3.2 GB of RAM
 *   2. page permissions cannot be changed on what is mapped in the window:
 *      it is left in the ProcessMem state, which lacks PermChangeAllowed
 *   3. the exception handler cannot make system calls
 *
 * The design
 *
 * - The window is virtual space reserved with virtmemAddReservation. Empty.
 * - Memory is committed in chunks, and each chunk carries its shadow alias: the
 *   codeAlias that is needed anyway in order to map (see the dance below). That
 *   alias is always accessible, at a private address.
 * - A chunk committed at a mapping offset is mapped into every view that covers
 *   that offset, each view on its first access (RexGmFaultIn). That is where the
 *   360 mirrors come from, for free.
 * - "Protecting" a page means unmapping it from the window. Logical permissions
 *   are kept in a table of our own, because the kernel does not keep them for us.
 * - The exception handler emulates the access by writing or reading through the
 *   shadow alias. It never makes system calls.
 *
 * The commit dance, which is not obvious
 *
 *   memalign()                     backing, from the newlib heap
 *   virtmemFindCodeMemory()        free range in the code region
 *   svcMapProcessCodeMemory()      turns the backing into a code alias
 *   svcSetProcessMemoryPermission  RW permissions on that alias
 *   svcMapProcessMemory()          mirrors the alias into each view
 *
 * svcMapProcessMemory rejects heap memory as the source: it returns 0xD401
 * (Kernel/106, InvalidCurrentMemory). The detour through code memory is needed.
 * And beware: after svcMapProcessCodeMemory the original heap pointer is left
 * with permissions 0, marked as borrowed. It must not be touched.
