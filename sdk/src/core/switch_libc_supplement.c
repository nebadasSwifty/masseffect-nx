/**
 * @file        rex/core/switch_libc_supplement.c
 * @brief       POSIX functions that newlib declares but libnx does not implement
 *
 * Why it exists
 *
 * Found by linking the SDK's real rex::memory::Memory against rexcore for
 * Switch: everything resolves except six libc functions. newlib declares them in
 * its headers, so the code compiles without a warning; but nobody defines them,
 * and the failure only shows up at link time.
 *
 * The newlib headers are included on purpose: if any signature here does not
 * match the declared one, this file stops compiling instead of linking wrongly.

/*
 * --- pread / pwrite ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * newlib does not have them and Horizon offers no positioned read on a newlib
 * descriptor. They are emulated with lseek + read/write, which is not atomic:
 * between the lseek and the read another thread could move the position of the
 * same descriptor. That is why each descriptor has its own lock, spread over 64
 * stripes, and the position is restored at the end, as pread guarantees.
 *
 * The game reads its data through here (File::ReadSync), from several threads. A
 * single global lock would serialize all of the game's disk reads and would show
 * up as stutter when loading zones; with stripes, two different files do not
 * wait for each other.
 *
 * Known limitation: it only protects against other pread/pwrite calls. A direct
 * read() or lseek() on the same descriptor from another thread at the same time
 * could still clobber it. The SDK does not mix both styles on one file.

 * during static constructors, with no log and nothing on screen.
 *
 * This version writes the failure to <NRO folder>/logs/rex/rex_assert.log and
 * ends with diagAbortWithResult, which instead of a silent exit shows error
 * 2345-0048 and generates a crash report. Defining it here is enough: nobody uses
 * __assert, the other symbol in libc_a-assert.o, so that object never reaches
 * the link.
