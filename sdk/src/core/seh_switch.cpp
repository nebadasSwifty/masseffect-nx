/**
 * @file        rex/core/seh_switch.cpp
 * @brief       SEH interface (rex/platform/seh.h) for Horizon
 *
 * What SEH does in this SDK
 *
 * The generator wraps guest functions that have SEH scopes in
 * SEH_TRY / SEH_CATCH_ALL / SEH_RETHROW (include/rex/platform/exceptions.h).
 * Outside Windows that is a C++ try/catch with a SehGuard that turns on
 * seh_active(), and the SIGSEGV handler in seh_posix.cpp throws a SehException
 * from the fault itself.
 *
 * Why faults are not turned into exceptions here
 *
 * 1. On Horizon you cannot throw from the fault handler. It runs on a separate
 *    stack and there is no signal frame to unwind through; measured on the
 *    console, you cannot even return from it.
 *
 * 2. The alternative (diverting the thread to a trampoline that throws in a
 *    normal context) requires the faulting instruction to be covered by the
 *    compiler's unwind and call-site tables, which normally needs
 *    -fnon-call-exceptions. The generator's CMake template only adds
 *    asynchronous EH flags on Windows, so there is no guarantee that the catch
 *    would ever run: the likely outcome would be std::terminate.
 *
 * 3. This port does not use it. generate_exception_handlers is false by default, and
 *    it is commented out in app/overrides.toml. With that off, the SEH macros are
 *    not emitted.
 *
 * So a fault inside an SEH scope is treated like any other unresolved fault: a
 * fatal stop with the register dump. It is recorded in the thread's SEH state in
 * case it helps diagnosis. Games that rely on SEH are not supported by this
 * implementation; point 2 is the part that is missing.
