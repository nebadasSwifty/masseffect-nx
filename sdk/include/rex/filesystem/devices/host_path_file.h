   * Read-ahead window.
   *
   * On Horizon every NtReadFile from the game became a pread() against the SD with no buffering in
   * between: the descriptor is opened with a bare open() (filesystem_posix.cpp), so there is not even the
   * stdio buffer. A file read header by header (the .gin, the .abk, the indices) means dozens of trips to
   * the card to read a few bytes each time.
   *
   * A window is read in one go and whatever falls inside is served from RAM. Files that fit whole in the
   * window end up entirely in memory, which is exactly what was wanted for the small, frequently opened
   * ones.
   *
   * Only on read-only devices. It is never enabled for saves and profiles: there the bytes change under
   * our feet and a stale window would mean a corrupted save.
   *
   * If a refill returns less than requested (end of file, or a short read from the file system, which
   * cannot be told apart from here), the request is answered with the usual direct read; after the
   * fourth in a row the window is turned off for this file. It never returns less than the path without
   * the window would have.
   *
   * The window used to be dead, and it cost something too. Measured (472.9 MB over 1,290 reads): 5 hits
   * out of 1,232 eligible reads = 0.41 %, 0.3 MB served from RAM out of 472.9 MB (0.06 %), and 66
   * refills x 64 KB = 4.1 MB of SD reads spent to serve those 0.3 MB. A net loss.
   *
   * The cause was the threshold: only requests of at most window/4 go into the window, i.e. 16 KB with a
   * 64 KB window. The game's average read is 375 KB; the smallest it does in a loop is 64 KB (it is in
   * the binary itself: a loop calls NtReadFile with r9 = 0x10000). Not a single game read
   * was under 16 KB, so all of them took the direct path.
   *
   * Fix: the window is now 256 KB, which puts the threshold at 64 KB and catches exactly the game's
   * 64 KB loop; and the cap on live windows drops from 128 to 16 (there were never more than 10), so the
   * RAM ceiling drops from 8 MB to 4 MB. It comes with an audit: if after 8 refills this file has not
   * given at least one hit per refill, the pattern is not sequential and the window is turned off for
   * it; that way it can never again be pure cost in silence.
